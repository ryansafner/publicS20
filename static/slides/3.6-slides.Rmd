- **"Bureaucracy,"** **"Bureaucratic,"** and **"Bureaucrat"** all have a negative connotation

- Let's be positive (analytical), not normative (judgmental) about this

- Bureaucrats & bureaus are people and organizations too!

- von Mises: "**profit management**" vs. "**bureaucratic management**"

- Bureaucracy is not an evil, the only alternative to profit management

- To the extent collective choice is necessary, so is bureaucracy
  - Firms can be bureaucratic
  - Market failures may require government, run bureaucratically

- Managers cannot be autonomous--abuse funds and no way to verify efficient use

- Thus, managers must comply with specific rules about use of money and activities, often determined by legislature

$$u(z,c)$$
