# Markets and Pareto Efficiency

.pull-left[

- Pareto efficiency is conceptual gold standard: allow all welfare-improving exchanges so long as nobody gets harmed

- In practice: Pareto efficiency is a *first best* solution
    - only takes one holdout to disapprove to violate Pareto

# Markets and Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency

.pull-left[

- .hi[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]: an action improves efficiency its generates more social gains than losses
    - those made better off could in principle compensate those made worse off

- .hi[Kaldor-Hicks efficiency]: no potential Kaldor-Hicks improvements exist

- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)
    
- Consider policies where winners' maximum WTP `\(&gt;\)` losers' minimum WTA

- Policies should **maximize social value of resources**

# Welfare Economics

- .hi[1st Fundamental Welfare Theorem]: markets in competitive equilibrium maximize allocative efficiency of resources and are Pareto efficient

- Markets are great when they: 

1. Are .hi-purple[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers

2. Reach .hi-purple[equilibrium]: absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand

3. .hi-purple[No externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions
