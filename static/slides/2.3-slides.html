We need to .hi[create a State to constrain individuals] from interfering against one another...but .hi[we also need to constrain the State]

- .hi[Constitutional rules] define the .hi-purple[domain of allowed collective decisions] and the .hi-purple[rules or procedures] for doing so

- Their practical function is .hi-purple[to protect minorities from the majority]

.pull-left[

.hi-purple[Political rules] allow us to make one collective choice for all, even though many will disagree with the outcome

We must .hi[agree at a constitutional level] so that .hi-purple[we can disagree on political outcomes]

- Incorrect to start from Hobbes (no rules); irrelevant to our actual decisions

- Constitutional economics is practically about *reform* of rules, rather than designing from scratch
