# Spatial Voting Theory

# Spatial Voting Theory

- We can get a bit more advanced about preferences beyond mere orderings (e.g. $A \succ B \succ C)$

- Also, ways to avoid cycling

- Consider competition between candidates or proposals in .hi-purple[issue space] (i.e. a range of alternative choices along a single dimension)

# Spatial Voting Theory

Features of Spatial Competition models:

--
1. **Voter preferences are represented by distance**
  - Preferences are "single-peaked" with unique ideal preference
  - Voters prefer candidates or proposals closer to their ideal preference
  - Less distance $\implies$ greater utility

--
2. **Platforms are formed endogenously**
  - Candidates (or proposals) compete *spatially*
  - Want to maximize the number of voters "close" to your platform 

--

- Under these assumptions, a testable prediction about the outcome: .hi[The center (median) of the distribution of preferences is a Condorcet winner]
