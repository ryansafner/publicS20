- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)
    
- Consider policies where winners' maximum WTP $>$ losers' minimum WTA

- Policies should **maximize social value of resources**

# Welfare Economics I

- .hi[1st Fundamental Welfare Theorem]: markets in competitive equilibrium maximize allocative efficiency of resources and are Pareto efficient

- Markets are great when they: 

1. Are .hi-purple[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers

2. Reach .hi-purple[equilibrium]: absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand

3. .hi-purple[No externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions
