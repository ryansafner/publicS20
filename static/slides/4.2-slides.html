&gt; "Imagine that a person in a position to alter your career invites you to a party at his home. When you arrive at the party, the talk of the moment seems to be about the living room's pale neutral colors, the latest trend in interior decoration. The look does not appeal to you, but you would rather not say so, lest your host be hurt. Feeling pressured to say something, you compliment his 'sophisticated taste'...

&gt; "Your evening contained [an instance] of .hi[_preference falsification_, the act of misrepresenting one's genuine wants under perceived social pressures]...[Y]ou conveyed impressions at odds with your private thoughts and desires, at least partly to avoid disapproval." (pp.3-4).

&gt; "A phrase that captures the meaning of preference falsification exactly is .hi['living a lie.'] It was developed by East European dissidents during their long winter of communist dictatorship....hi[To live a lie is to be burdened by one's lie.] The source of the burden could be the .hi[guilt] one suffers for having avoided social responsibility, or the .hi[anger] one experiences for having failed to live up to one's personal standards, or the .hi[resentment] one feels for having been induced to suppress one's individuality," (pp.4-5).

&gt; "The reason our individual might opt for preference falsification is that his public preferences influence how he is valued and treated...Insofar as he deviates from society's dominant goals, he will lose status and suffer rejection...Through participation in the social system, he gains access to goods and services he could not possibly acquire on his own," (pp.26-27).

&gt; "The distinction between in-trinsic and reputational utility is crucial to what follows. Intrinsic utility flows from substantive outcomes, reputational utility from reactions to one's public preferences," (p.29).

# Spatial Models, Again

- Consider the **spatial model** of collective decision-making again

- A single issue, with options as a spectrum from 0 to 100

- Individual has .hi-purple["single-peaked preferences"] along a spectrum of options

- Let `\(x =\)` option where intrinsic utility is maximized

- Let `\(y =\)` option where reputational utility is maximized

- If `\(x \neq y\)`, .hi[preference falsification]

&gt; "Our choices must be satisfying a need other than social approval and respect. This other need, I submit, is a need for individuality, autonomy, dignity, and integrity. I am proposing that we value the freedom to choose; that we derive self-esteem from resisting social pressures...that we find satisfaction in speaking our minds, opening up our hearts, acting ourselves. Conversely, when we opt to suppress a thought, misrepresent a want, or assume a phony demeanor, we feel discomfort at having compromised our personhood," (p.31).

- "We should put people ahead of profits"

&gt; "Under common circumstances, the transformations of public opinion will eventually produce an equilibrium. That is, public opinion will become self-reproducing," (p.18).

&gt; "At any given equilibrium, public opinion may differ from private opinion. In fact, the equilibrium may owe its existence and stability largely to preference falsification on the part of people unsympathetic to the policies it makes possible. Such disgruntled people, even if they form a huge majority, will refrain from dissenting because of social pressures-pressures that they themselves sustain through acts of preference falsification. One socially significant consequence of preference falsification is thus widespread public support for policies that would be rejected in a vote taken by secret ballot," (p.18).

&gt; "The possibility of unanticipated revolution rests critically on two factors: the imperfect observability of the criteria on which individuals base their public preferences and the interdependence of those public preferences. allow small, unobserved changes in private variables to galvanize explosive changes in public opinion. By the same token, they allow private variables to undergo major changes without triggering changes in public opinion. That is, they make it possible for profound transformations to occur, and much tension to build up, in a society that appears asleep. Deceptive stability and explosive change are thus two sides of a single coin," (pp.20-21)
