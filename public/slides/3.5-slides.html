  - What voters want
  - What special interests want
  - What the politican honestly believes

Recall the .hi[Median Voter Theorem]: politicians are trying to get close to what they believe the median voter wants

- Politicians may have their own honest convictions about issues

- Tradeoff: honest convictions vs. winning (adopting median voter's preferences)
  - Only winners get to enact their policies!

- Big speeches, ribbon cutting ceremonies, attack ads on rivals, etc

# Recall: District Voting

.pull-left[
- Election to Congress involves (1) aggregating individual votes in State (.hi-purple[districts]) and then (2) taking the majority vote of those districts

- Party winning most seats not necessarily the party that wins the most votes

- .hi-green[Example]: in 2012, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives earned 50.59% of the popular vote but only attained 46.21% of the seats

- Suppose the State has 4 districts, and each district elects a Member
  - State sends 3 Yellows, 1 Green to Congress

- Special interests are often distributed geographically
  - Farming in rural areas
  - Flooding in coastal areas
  - Urban areas
  - Military bases

.pull-left[
.center[
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jzgjogfxnqm7svn/largestcompaniesbystate.jpg?raw=1)
]
]

.pull-right[

- The function of each Member is to benefit their district

- Voters &amp; special interests with strong geographic concentration tend to flock to those legislators

- But how can a legislator get their constituents' agenda passed if they are just 1/435 (or 1/100)?

.pull-right[
- Consider politics as a market for votes

- Imagine two groups: 
  - Group 1 prefers policy `\(A \succ B\)`
  - Group 2 prefers policy `\(B \succ A\)`

- In theory, `\(1\)` can persuade `\(2\)` to support `\(A\)` in exchange for some .hi-purple[side payment], i.e. **1 buys 2's vote**

.pull-right[
- That transaction would be a **Pareto improvement**! (Or at least, a **Kaldor-Hicks improvement**)

- Both groups are better off: 1 gets policy `\(A\)`, 2 is **compensated** by 1

- This is the .hi[Coase theorem] in politics: parties can bargain to a socially efficient outcome
  - Like the doctor (or baker) paying off the baker (or doctor)

.pull-right[
- However, in many cases in politics, this less likely to happen because of **high transaction costs**

- How would such a vote contract be enforceable?
  - No property rights in politics!
  - Public opinion could change between the votes
  - No way to credibly commit to upholding promise

.pull-left[

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/twc3e6q25yhmd68/secretballot.jpg?raw=1)

.pull-right[

- Votes in Congress are often publicly recorded

- This actually enhances the market for vote trading in Congress
  - provides verification that each side held up their end of the bargain
  
- **Secret ballots** raise transaction costs and prevent agreements or vote trades
  - no way to verify, easier to renege

- .hi["Pork barrel" legislation]: law that only benefits a narrow regional interest at taxpayer expense, solely for representative to bring money to their district

&gt; As in previous years, all items in the Congressional Pig Book meet at least one of CAGW’s seven criteria, but most satisfy at least two:
    Requested by only one chamber of Congress;
    Not specifically authorized;
    Not competitively awarded;
    Not requested by the President;
    Greatly exceeds the President’s budget request or the previous year’s funding;
    Not the subject of congressional hearings; or
    Serves only a local or special interest.

.pull-right[

- One way these bills get enacted is .hi[logrolling] or a .hi[quid-pro-quo]: exchange of votes between legislators

&gt; "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"

# Logrolling

.pull-left[
- .hi-green[Example]: suppose you have a national Senate with 5 districts: A, B, C, D, E, each with 1 Senator
  - Voters in district A want a military base
  - Voters in district B want a dam
  - Voters in district C want a monument
  - Each must be paid for by country's taxpayers

# Logrolling

| Senator | A-Base | B-Dam | C-Monument |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| A | +10 | -3 | -3 |
| B | -3 | +10 | -3 |
| C | -3 | -3 | +10 |
| D | -3 | -3 | -3 |
| E | -3 | -3 | -3 |
| TOTAL | -2 | -2 | -2 |

--

- If each bill (A, B, C) was voted on separately For/Against, each would fail
  - A 4:1 majority against

---

# Logrolling

| Senator | A-Base | B-Dam | C-Monument | COMBINED |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| A | +10 | -3 | -3 | +4 |
| B | -3 | +10 | -3 | +4 |
| C | -3 | -3 | +10 | +4 |
| D | -3 | -3 | -3 | -9 |
| E | -3 | -3 | -3 | -9 |
| TOTAL | -2 | -2 | -2 | -6 |


- If the three were combined in a single .hi[omnibus bill]:
  - A, B, C form coalition to vote FOR
  - D, E vote AGAINST
- Bill would pass, giving each Senator their pork project

  - Easier for Committee to make amendments, attach "riders", that satisfy most members of Committee
