1. .hi["Exit"]: leave the organization (for another)

2. .hi["Voice"]: influence the organization without leaving (i.e. complain, protest, persuade, lobby)

3. .hi["Loyalty"]: remain silent, suffer the deterioration

.pull-right[

- Economists focus almost exclusively on .hi[exit]

- Ideal of perfect competition
  - If a firm raises price (suffers high costs), simply switch to one of its countless competitors!

- Exit is **silent**!
  - Requires no confrontation
  - Simply abstain from showing up again!

- In markets, buyers and sellers are *constantly* forming and destroying many relationships
  - "If my grocer does not have what I want, I fire them!"

- .hi-purple["Alert customers"] have .hi-purple[elastic] demand, *very sensitive* to changes in quality
  - These customers will leave at the smallest fall in quality

.pull-right[

- Seems optimal for a firm to have a mix of *both* "alert" and "inert" customers during a decline:
  - Alert customers exit and provide the warning sign to firms
  - Inert customers stay and provide a "cushion" for firm to stay afloat while rectifying the problem

- Firm with *only* alert customers would go out of business
  - Any decline in quality would cause all alert customers to exit

.pull-right[

- Exit and a very competitive marketplace creates a potential problem:

- Hyper quality-conscious buyers always believe they can exit and find a better option
  - "Grass is always greener" illusion

- If every minor decline in quality drives one to search for a better product, one may never stop searching!

.pull-right[
- Voice and exit may be **inversely related** in a lot of organizations

- Voice might be used more where exit is not possible

- The stronger voice is, the less likely exit needs to be used
  - Demand will become less elastic with respect to quality
  - i.e. people put up with more if they feel they are being heard

- The weaker voice is (e.g. stifling dissent), more likely exit will be used

.pull-right[
- In economic theory, one of the many benefits of competition is it keeps would-be-monopolists on their toes

.pull-right[
- Hirschman: the reverse can actually be a problem too!

- Users who are *most* quality-sensitive (elastic) will be the first ones to exit and not buy from a deteriorating firm

- These may be the very people who would be the most vocal and demand change!

- Firm is left with least quality-sensitive (inelastic) customers who can tolerate mediocrity

.pull-right[
- Hirschman: might a lazy monopolist with no exit-option be better than competition?

- If exit is ineffective, monopolist retains all of its most quality-conscious users

- These users are locked in, voice becomes stronger
  - they are precisely the ones who will speak up and demand change

- Lazy monopolists would welcome competition as a release from effort and effective criticism!
  - (reduce voice, most quality-sensitive would exit instead)

.pull-right[
- Hirschman: which is worse, a monopolist with everyone locked-in, or a weaker monopolist that is able to survive the departure of its most vocal critics?

- A more frequent danger of monopoly is not that it will exploit customers to max profits, but that it is unable to combat declining quality, mediocrity, and incompetence!

3. .blue[Voice] must be costly to .hi-red[State] `\((\color{red}{V&gt;0})\)`
