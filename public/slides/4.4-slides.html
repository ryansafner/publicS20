- Most basic power of the State is the power to tax

- Often two types of reasons for a tax:
    1. Raise revenue for the provision of public goods and transfers
    2. Discourage or encourage certain behaviors and transactions

- Taxes thus have two effects:
    1. Generate tax revenue
    2. Distort individual incentives

- Economists focus on the .hi[incidence] of taxation: .hi-purple[how does a tax change behavior and affect welfare?]

- A tax imposes a .hi-purple[statutory burden] on party *legally required* to pay the tax

- This does not directly translate to the .hi[economic burden], who actually bears the incidence of the tax

- Economic and statutory burdens are not the same thing!

- Parties may be able to alter their behavior to .hi-purple[avoid] or .hi-purple[shift] it onto others
  - Businesses may pass higher prices onto consumers
  - Consumers can switch to lesser-taxed substitutes (including nothing)
  - People may move their wealth into lesser-taxed assets or jurisdictions
