# Let's First Address: Connotation

.pull-left[
- **"Bureaucracy,"** **"Bureaucratic,"** and **"Bureaucrat"** all have a negative connotation

- Let's be positive (analytical), not normative (judgmental) about this

- Bureaucrats &amp; bureaus are people and organizations too!

- Understand their incentives, how they work, and compare to other institutions

.pull-right[

- .hi-purple[Bureaucrats] are career government employees that work for various government agencies
  - "Civil service"
  - "Public administration"

- Point is: **isolated from politics**
  - Not elected, very hard to fire
  - Focus on administration and rule-making, not public opinion

.pull-right[

- Weak or underdeveloped States suffer from .hi-purple[political patronage], .hi-purple[clientelism], or the .hi-purple["spoils system"]

- Politicians appoint their friends, allies, and cronies to public offices regardless of qualification

.pull-right[

- Most modern democracies have very developed bureaucracies
  - Meritocracy and expertise over political connections
  - Rational rules over loyalty
  - Very difficult to fire bureaucrat (insulated from politics)

- Divorce .hi-purple[politics] from .hi-purple[administration]
  - Conversely, anti-democratic

  - "Independent" of President

.footnote[

.right-column[

- von Mises: "**profit management**" vs. "**bureaucratic management**"

- Bureaucracy is not an evil, the only alternative to profit management

- To the extent collective choice is necessary, so is bureaucracy
  - Firms can be bureaucratic
  - Market failures may require government, run bureaucratically
]

# Profit Management

.pull-right[

- Does not use prices or profits, cannot determine efficient use of capital

- Managers cannot be autonomous--abuse funds and no way to verify efficient use

- Thus, managers must comply with specific rules about use of money and activities, often determined by legislature

2. **In order to maximize:** .hi-green[&lt; utility &gt;]

3. **Subject to:** .hi-red[&lt; restrictions set by legislature &gt;]

- Bureaucrat maximizes own utility

`$$u(z,c)$$`

- Two ideal types of bureaucrat (or hybrid):
  - "Zealots"
  - "Climbers"

.pull-right[

`$$u(z,c)$$`

- .hi-purple["Zealots"] want to maximize rules made to reshape the world in their ideal vision

- Truly believe that existing market equilibria are wrong

- Note: this `\(\neq\)` socially optimal regulation (necessarily)
  - Zealot may be mistaken, have unique preferences, etc.

.pull-right[

`$$u(z,c)$$`

- .hi-purple["Climbers"] want to maximize own career prospects or perks
  - May involve passing more rules (to put on resume)

- Want promotions, high salary, good work environment, more respect/clout, more subordinates to manage, directing more resources (bigger budget)

1. President submits a budget *request* to Congress for fiscal year (October 1)

2. House and Senate pass their own budget resolutions ("appropriation bill")

3. Appropriations Committees in each house mark up the bills

4. Houses reconcile their differences, send to President

&gt; "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed...The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement."

    - unelected, unaccountable, bureaucrats
  - Can Congress delegate *legislative* power to *executive* agencies?
