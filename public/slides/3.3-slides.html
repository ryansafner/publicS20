# The Story So Far

.pull-left[

- Voters imperfectly vote for a candidate closest to their preferences

- Voters have poor incentives `\((MC&gt;MB)\)` to inform themselves or to vote for the *best* candidate
  - Good governance is a public good with .hi-purple[free rider problem]
  - .hi[Rational ignorance]
  - .hi[Rational irrationality]

# What's Wrong With 1P1V?

.pull-left[

- The bedrock of democracy is the idea of .hi[One person, one vote (1p1v)]
  - Everyone has equal voice in the outcome

- Used to argue for extending the franchise to women, African Americans, etc

- Constitution requires representation in Congress apportioned to population

.pull-left[

- U.S. only started protecting a lot of abused minorities in 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century

- Mostly result of federal court cases
  - Not very democratic! Unelected, unaccountable life-long judges
  - Seem to rely on preferences of judges

# What's Wrong With 1P1V: Ordinality

.pull-left[
- Voting systems give equal weight to preferences by person

- No way to differentiate **preferences** or **intensities**
  - Only .hi-purple[ordinal rankings]: `\(A &gt; B\)` or `\(A &lt; B\)`

- An indifferent, lethargic majority, can outvote a passionate minority

# Cardinality: In Markets

.pull-left[

- In markets, not only more choices, but can indulge **intensity** of your preferences

- If you *want* 4 more cookies, you can buy 4 more cookies

- Goods flow to those that value them the most, willing to pay the most

.pull-right[

- Suppose society votes to zone land for cattle ranching, optimum at A

- But more ranching imposes a cost on Farmer Frank (Cows eat his crops)

- Without Frank, optimal ranching is at A.

- But with him, .hi-red[social cost] increases, moving social optimum back to B.

- In some sense, Frank imposes an externality on society for reducing its ranching from A to B

- Frank should have to "pay" for the additional external cost imposed, which is the area of the **DWL triangle**

- .hi-purple[Area of DWL triangle grows in size with the *square* of the reduction in quantity]

- More valuable land (.hi-blue[higher MSB]) is prevented from becoming farmland
  - Value of lost farmland is *increasing* as more farmland is being lost!

.pull-right[

- But this ruling is going to be determined by **votes**, not market prices or transactions

- Under 1p1v, marginal cost of "buying" votes is constant

- Those that care very much try to buy all the votes
  - Cost per vote to them is too low

- Those that don't care very much
  - Cost per vote to them is too high

.pull-right[

- Posner &amp; Weyl's proposal: .hi["Quadratic Voting"]

1.  What if people could "buy" votes to spend on an issue

2. The total cost of buying votes should increase **quadratically**
    - i.e. cost of `\(n\)` votes is `\(n^2\)`; or 
    - most votes you could buy with `\(x\)` is `\(\sqrt{x}\)`

- Unlike 1p1v, .hi-purple[Marginal cost of additional vote increases proportionate to the number of votes cast]

# Proposed Benefits of Quadratic Voting

.pull-left[

- Get a better indication of people's preferences

- Reduces strategic voting, cycling, free-rider problem

- More of an incentive to inform oneself - have one's votes count proportionate to degree of interest

- .hi-purple[A passionate minority can now outvote an indifferent majority]
  - Is that what we want??

# How Might it Work?

.pull-left[

- Imagine each person is given a budget of "voice credits" `\(Q\)` per year (e.g. 100 `\(Q)\)`

- For each issue, individual can expend `\(x\)` `\(Q\)`-credits to cast `\(\sqrt{x}\)` votes

- `\(Q\)`-credits "rollover" if not spent on issues

- Can save credits for issues you care more about

# How Might it Work?

.pull-left[

- Each person can cast as many votes as desired **FOR** and **AGAINST** any proposal

- If total votes For `\(&gt;\)` total votes Against, resolution passes (and vice versa)

# How Might it Work?

.pull-left[

- Multiple option voting: 
  - Have a default option
  - People can cast as many votes FOR and AGAINST as many options as they want
  - If any option gets the most votes, enacted
  - If no option gets most votes, default option enacted
