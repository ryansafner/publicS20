The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation and foreign commerce;... the powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and prosperities of the people," (Federalist 45).

Consider a model with the following assumptions:

1. There are many communities, each with their own level of taxes and public goods.
2. Consumers are mobile, and can choose which community matches their preferences.
3. There is no cost of relocating
4. Consumers have complete information
5. There are no spillovers across communities
6. There are optimal sizes of communities (e.g. congestion vs. economies of scale)
7. Differences in community attractiveness (taxes, benefits) will be capitalized into housing prices
